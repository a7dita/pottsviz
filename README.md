# Pottsviz

## Pottsviz is an interactive visualization tool for playing with memory /latching/ in the fascinating _Potts associative neural network_.

### Instructions

First, compile the C++ files located in backend/.
Next, from the root directory, run `pnpm install` to install the required node modules.
Finally, use `pnpm run dev` to run the application. The terminal will show a local port http://localhost:XXXX/ that will open the interface in the browser.

### Caution

Please be aware that, for the time being, the backend process needs to be manually terminated.

### Acknowledgements

Kwang Il Ryom greatly inspired me to work on this idea, and his insights and active collaboration significantly contributed to this project.
